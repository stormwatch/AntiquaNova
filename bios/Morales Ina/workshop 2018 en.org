* To breathe life into dead matter. /An active exploration on the poetics of things./

Object Theater is a concept that brings together multiple poetics that approach
the object from a broad point of view, material, conceptual, literal,
philosophical, etc. It is a contemporary expression that may appropriate past
forms as well, and wants to experiment, and open spaces in order to find other
ways to express employing the views and resources that allow the realization of
an artistic production.

This workshop will focus on transforming the state of stillness of the objects
in order to explore new scenic possibilities in which it may become the leading
character; exploring the different animation techniques in order to breathe life
into an object; recognizing the possibilities of manipulation: direct, indirect,
at a distance, with and without rods; encouraging interpretation excercises by
which the discovery of the possibilities and limits of the materials may be
enabled.
